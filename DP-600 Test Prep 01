Question 24: Incorrect
You are building a semantic model in Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) Gen2 for a retail analytics application. The model needs to enforce dynamic row-level security (RLS) based on a user's assigned department in Azure Active Directory (AAD). Department information is stored in a separate table within the ADLS Gen2 container.

Which combination of Azure Synapse Analytics and Azure Data Factory services would you use to achieve dynamic RLS in this scenario?

A. Synapse Spark pools and Data Factory copy activity
B. Synapse SQL pools and Data Factory managed virtual networks
C. Synapse external tables and Data Factory data flows
D. Synapse integration runtime and Data Factory linked services
•	C
(Correct)
•	D
•	B
(Incorrect)
•	A
Explanation
C. Synapse external tables and Data Factory data flows

Explanation:

Incorrect answers:
A: Synapse Spark pools are not suitable for dynamic RLS, and the copy activity in Data Factory is for data movement, not security enforcement.
B: Synapse SQL pools offer limited RLS capabilities and Data Factory managed virtual networks are for network isolation, not security filtering.

D: Ingesting data directly into a single table doesn't facilitate de-aggregation or real-time analysis.
C: Stream analytics jobs can process data streams in real-time, apply window functions to group data by time intervals (e.g., daily) for each machine, and output a unified data stream ready for dashboard consumption.
Question 48: Correct
You are a data analyst at AdventureWorks, a travel company, tasked with building a Power BI report to analyze customer demographics and booking data. The data resides in a semantic model exposed through the XMLA endpoint within the Fabric platform.

Which of the following approaches would be MOST efficient for connecting to the data and creating the report?

A. Use the Power BI Desktop XMLA connector to directly connect to the endpoint and create the report.
B. Extract the data from the semantic model using Azure Data Factory and load it into an Azure Synapse Analytics workspace for Power BI to access.
C. Develop a custom Python script utilizing the xmla library to connect and query the data, then export it for Power BI consumption.
D. Leverage the Fabric visual query editor to explore the data and export it to a CSV file for use in Power BI.
•	B
•	A
(Correct)
•	D
•	C
Explanation
A. Use the Power BI Desktop XMLA connector to directly connect to the endpoint and create the report.

Explanation:

Option B adds unnecessary data movement and complexity.
Option C requires additional coding expertise and might be less efficient than native tools.
Option D is inefficient for large datasets and doesn't leverage the semantic model's capabilities.
Option A provides the most efficient and direct approach. Power BI's built-in XMLA connector allows seamless connection to the semantic model, enabling you to explore data, build visualizations, and create reports directly within the familiar Power BI environment.
Question 49: Incorrect
Your Jupyter notebook in Microsoft Fabric uses an iterative loop to calculate customer lifetime values for a large dataset. The analysis takes hours to complete, hindering your ability to quickly iterate on different scenarios.

Which of the following techniques would be most impactful in improving the performance of the customer lifetime value calculations within the notebook?

A. Use vectorized operations like Pandas vectorized functions instead of standard loops for calculations.
B. Implement caching mechanisms within the notebook to store intermediate results and avoid recomputations.
C. Leverage Spark SQL or Azure Data Factory to offload the heavy calculations to a distributed processing engine.
D. Optimize the code by removing unnecessary data manipulation steps and redundant variable assignments.
•	B
•	A
(Incorrect)
•	D
•	C
(Correct)
Explanation
C. Leverage Spark SQL or Azure Data Factory to offload the heavy calculations to a distributed processing engine.

Explanation:

Option A improves performance on small calculations, but not significantly for complex, iterative computations.
Option B reduces redundant calculations within the notebook, but doesn't address the inherent limitations of single-threaded execution.
Option D is important for code efficiency, but might not be enough for such a computationally intensive task.
Option C provides the most significant performance improvement. Offloading the calculations to Spark SQL or Azure Data Factory leverages distributed processing power and parallel execution, dramatically reducing the analysis time for iterative customer lifetime value calculations.
Question 50: Correct
You are building a semantic model in Azure Synapse Analytics that includes customer data with sensitive financial information. You want to implement object-level security (OLS) to restrict access to specific customer records based on user roles.

Which Azure Synapse Analytics features would you use to achieve OLS in this scenario?

A. Synapse Views with security predicates
B. Synapse Permissions on Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2
C. Synapse SQL pool Row Level Security policies
D. Synapse Integration Runtime Managed Service Identity
•	D
•	B
•	C
•	A
(Correct)
Explanation
A. Synapse Views with security predicates

Explanation:

Incorrect answers:
B: Synapse Permissions on Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 only control access to the underlying data files, not specific records within the semantic model.
C: Synapse SQL pool Row Level Security policies apply to tables, not individual objects within a model.
D: Synapse Integration Runtime Managed Service Identity is used for authentication, not access control within the semantic model.
Correct answer: A. Synapse Views provide a virtualized layer over the underlying data. You can define security predicates within the view definition that filter data based on user roles or other criteria. This effectively implements OLS within the semantic model, granting access only to authorized users for specific customer records.
